# layrz_ui_extensions

Adapters and extensions bridging Layrz packages into `layrz_ui` — including the `layrz_i18n` binding and conversions from `layrz_sdk` models into layrz_ui types.

## What is layrz_ui_extensions?

`layrz_ui_extensions` is a collection of adapters and type converters that bridge Layrz ecosystem packages into `layrz_ui`, keeping the design system lightweight and decoupled from heavy dependencies.

**Included:**
- **i18n binding** — Routes `LayrzUiL10n` lookups through the `layrz_i18n` translation engine. `layrz_ui` declares the contract with 133 English strings but has no i18n dependency; this adapter enables translation. Once registered, every `layrz_ui` component automatically picks up your translations.
- **SDK model conversions** (coming soon) — Adapters converting `layrz_sdk` types into `layrz_ui` view types, so `layrz_ui` itself needs no dependency on `layrz_sdk`.

---

## Installation

Add both packages to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  layrz_ui: ^0.0.9
  layrz_ui_extensions: ^0.0.2
```

`layrz_ui_extensions` requires `layrz_ui >= 0.0.9` because that is where `LayrzUiL10n` was introduced. Both packages version independently.

---

## Usage

1. Initialize the `layrz_i18n` engine with your translation data:

```dart
import 'package:layrz_i18n/layrz_i18n.dart';
import 'package:layrz_ui_extensions/layrz_ui_extensions.dart';

void main() async {
  final i18n = LayrzI18n(languages: [
    'en', 'es', 'pt',  // or your supported locales
  ]);
  await i18n.load();
  
  runApp(MyApp(i18n: i18n));
}
```

2. Register `LayrzUiI18nDelegate` in your app before the default English fallback:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final LayrzI18n i18n;
  const MyApp({required this.i18n});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayrzApp(
      title: 'My App',
      theme: LayrzThemeData.light(),
      localizationsDelegates: [
        LayrzUiI18nDelegate(i18n),      // Your custom translations
        const LayrzUiL10nDelegate(),    // English fallback
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en'),
        const Locale('es'),
        const Locale('pt'),
      ],
      home: const HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

3. That's it. Every `layrz_ui` component reading `context.l10n` now automatically uses your translations.

---

## Important: The Delegate Type Requirement

When implementing a custom localization delegate, **you must type it over `LayrzUiL10n`, not a subclass**.

```dart
// ✅ CORRECT
class MyDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<LayrzUiL10n> { ... }

// ❌ WRONG
class MyDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<LayrzUiI18n> { ... }
```

Why? Flutter's `Localizations.of<T>()` looks up delegates by their `type` parameter. If you type a delegate over a subclass, the resolver never finds it — it only looks for `LocalizationsDelegate<LayrzUiL10n>`. The result is silent fallback to English with no error message.

`LayrzUiI18nDelegate` follows this rule: it extends `LayrzUiL10nDelegate` and is typed over the base `LayrzUiL10n`, not `LayrzUiI18n`.

---

## Translation Keys

All 133 keys follow a dotted namespace pattern derived from the contract member names:

- Actions: `'actions.cancel'`, `'actions.save'`, `'actions.reset'`, `'actions.search'`, `'actions.lint'`, `'actions.run'`
- Confirmations: `'confirmations.title'`, `'confirmations.content'`, `'confirmations.confirm'`, `'confirmations.dismiss'`, `'confirmations.multipleTitle'`, `'confirmations.multipleContent'`
- About: `'about.search'`, `'about.poweredBy'`, `'about.platformOS'`
- Calendar: `'calendar.yearBack'`, `'calendar.yearNext'`, `'calendar.monthBack'`, `'calendar.monthNext'`, `'calendar.today'`, `'calendar.monthShort'`, and eleven month names
- Date-time pickers: `'dateTimePickers.from'`, `'dateTimePickers.to'`, `'dateTimePickers.selectDate'`, etc.
- And 13 more namespaces covering dual lists, dynamic avatars, editors, files, helpers, maps, notifications, passwords, required fields, select inputs, tables, taskbars, and weekdays

**Important**: These keys are **derived from member names and have not been verified against live translation data**. The implementation is correct; the key names follow a consistent pattern. You must validate that your `layrz_i18n` engine has entries for all 133 keys before deployment.

**Pluralization**: Eight duration-related keys use the `tc()` method for singular/plural selection. The translation engine must provide these in `' | '`-separated format:

```
'helpers.duration.days': '1 day | %count% days'
'helpers.duration.hours': '1 hour | %count% hours'
// ... and six more duration keys
```

---

## Partial Translation

You don't need to translate all 133 keys. Any key not present in the translation engine falls back to whatever `layrz_i18n`'s default behavior is (typically the key name or English). Moreover, any key not overridden in `LayrzUiI18n` inherits its English default from `LayrzUiL10n`, so new keys added to `layrz_ui` in future releases will continue to work without requiring your adapter to be updated.

---

## Decoupled Architecture

This package keeps `layrz_ui` lightweight by extracting bridging logic into `layrz_ui_extensions`:

- `layrz_ui` is purely a design system — no translation engine, no SDK, no heavy dependencies
- `layrz_ui_extensions` contains adapters that route lookups and conversions through dependent packages
- Each adapter is optional; apps choose which ones they need

This means:
- Apps using `layrz_ui` without i18n or SDK conversions have zero overhead
- Apps using different translation engines or model types can build their own adapters
- Both `layrz_ui` and its dependencies can evolve and release independently
